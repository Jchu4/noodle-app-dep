Technical Review  ---------

a) What part of the project went well, technically? Give at least one link to your repo as an example.

  - Ensuring the base game is functioning by focusing on the calcHandScore() function.
  
  - Code flows almost linearly from top to bottom.

b) What part the project was a struggle, technically? Give at least one link to your repo as an example.

  - Decompose the functions for HTML elements as I am still trying to understand when calling appendChild() affects the layout.

  - Finding a way to "tether" HTML elements & JS objects (like we did for Match Game)

c) What technical adjustments would you make for the next project? Why?

  - Would try to simplify code at every juncture possible so as to decompose certain blocks of code so as to be able to make changes/edits/tests more easily. 





Process Review  ---------
a) What in the approach and process during this project went well?

  - Tackling the first things first.


b) What in the approach and process during this project did not go well?

  - Flip cards (HTML) was not planned well in accordance to JS Objects.
  (there were ducplicates of my HTML element.)


c) What would you change in your process and approach in the next project? Why?

  - Would ensure front-end elements are all done up first before including any animation/interaction with the respective elements.


   Notes:
  - Can use anonymous functions for my EventListeners.
  - HTML Elements are duplicated
    - To tackle this in future, have a key to the HTML element, like an ID.
    - Think of the ID as a key - call the key, you get the data.
  - Decompose createDeck function outside of initGame()
    - Nested functions  (should be outside) eg. creatHandElement
  - Do not wait too long before you refactor.
    - Once it works for the context is in, can move on.

  Summary:
  - Having a high level approach 
    - Creating your helper functions & what it wants to done
  - Write out the skeleton first 
  - Then implement the helper functions
  - Comments & naming are good
  - Expression of the logic of calcHandScore was good (there is a hierarchy of bottom to top that makes it more understandable)
